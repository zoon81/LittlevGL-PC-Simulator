# This fork of the original LittlevGL PC simulator can be simply build with make

The original project can be build only in certain IDE, and I would like to build in command line.
In this way you can use any code editor for developing.

Before you can build this project, you need to set the project location in [Debug/makefile at line 9](https://github.com/zoon81/LittlevGL-PC-Simulator/blob/716428c110236a990fe3e96d0723dfa0e0429e23/Debug/makefile#L9):

```PROJ_LOCATION := "location_in_filesystem"```

After that you can build it with the next command:

Go to the Debug folder

```cd ./Debug```

Invoke make, if somehow the build was failed do not forget to make clean

```make && ./pc_simulator```

# PC project for Littlev Graphics Library

The [Littlev Graphic Library](https://github.com/littlevgl/lvgl) is written mainly for microcontrollers and embedded systems however you can run the library **on your PC** as well without any embedded hardware. The code written on PC can be simply copied when your are using an embedded system.

Using a PC simulator instead of an embedded hardware has got several advantages:
* **Costs $0** because you you don't have to buy design PCB
* **Fast** because you don't have to design an manufacture PCB
* **Collaborative** because any number of developers can work without hardware requirements
* **Developer friendly** because much easier and faster to debug on PC

## Requirements
* The PC simulator is cross platform so **Windows, Linux and OSX** is supported
* **SDL** a low level driver library to use graphics, handle mouse, keyboard etc.
* This project (configured for **Eclipse CDT IDE**)

## Usage

### Get the PC project

Clone the PC project and the related sub modules:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/littlevgl/pc_simulator_sdl_eclipse.git
```

or download it as zip [here](https://github.com/littlevgl/pc_simulator_sdl_eclipse/archive/dev-6.0.zip).

### Install SDL
You can download SDL from https://www.libsdl.org/

On Linux you can install it via terminal:
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libsdl2-dev
```

### Install Eclipse CDT
Download and install Eclipse CDT from  http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/

### Import the PC simulator project
1. Open Eclipse CDT
2. Click **File->Import** and choose **General->Existing project into Workspace**
3. Browse the root directory of the project and click Finish
4. Build your project and run it

## Docker
1. Build the docker container
```
docker build -t lvgl_simulator .
```
2. Run the docker container
```
docker run lvgl_simulator
```
GUI with docker is platform dependent. For example, on macOS you can follow 
[this tutorial](https://cntnr.io/running-guis-with-docker-on-mac-os-x-a14df6a76efc) 
and run a command similar to:
```
docker run -e DISPLAY=10.103.56.101:0 lvgl_simulator
```

## Contributing
1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
